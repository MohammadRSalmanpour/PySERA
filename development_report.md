        │   │   - Bug fix (configuration)
        ├── ├── v2.0.1 - 2025-10-20

        │   ├── v2.0.0 - 2025-10-19
        │   │   - Expanded feature library to 557 IBSI-compliant radiomics features across multiple categories and dimensions, providing comprehensive coverage for advanced radiomics analysis.
        │   │   - Introduced selective feature extraction with `categories` parameter, enabling users to target specific feature types: diagnostics (diag), morphological (morph), intensity peak (ip), first-order statistical (stat), intensity histogram (ih), intensity-volume histogram (ivh), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (glcm), Gray-Level Run Length Matrix (glrlm), Gray-Level Size Zone Matrix (glszm), Gray-Level Distance Zone Matrix (gldzm), Neighboring Gray-Tone Difference Matrix (ngtdm), Neighboring Gray-Level Dependence Matrix (ngldm), and moment-invariant (mi) features.
        │   │   - Added dimensional control with `dimensions` parameter, supporting first-order (1st), 2D slice-based (2D), 2.5D aggregated (2_5D), and fully volumetric 3D (3D) feature extraction strategies.
        │   │   - Integrated deep learning feature extraction with `extraction_mode="deep_feature"` supporting pre-trained models including ResNet50, VGG16, and DenseNet121 for advanced feature representation.
        │   │   - Implemented callback function system (`callback_fn`) for real-time progress tracking and external notification platform integration, receiving parameters: flag ("START"|"END"), image_id (str), roi_name (str).
        │   │   - Enhanced performance through optimized OOP architecture with improved RAM management and CPU-efficient parallel processing for large-scale batch operations.
        │   │   - Developed multi-level reporting system with `report` parameter offering "all" (full details), "info" (essential information), "warning" (warnings only), "error" (errors only), and "none" (no reporting) options.
        │   │   - Resolved stability issues and enhanced error handling across the feature extraction pipeline.
        │   │   - Improved documentation with comprehensive examples demonstrating selective feature extraction combinations and deep learning integration workflows.

        v1
        ├── v1.0
        │   ├── v1.0.2 - 2025-08-20
        │   │   - change PySera name to pysera
        │   │
        │   ├── v1.0.1 - 2025-08-20
        │   │   - fixing bug in numpy array file processing in in-memory mode
        │   │
        │   └── v1.0.0 - 2025-08-19
        │       - Optimized memory management by storing large RoIs as float32 NumPy arrays on disk with memory mapping, ensuring efficient management and preventing RAM overflows.  
        │       - Enabled robust feature extraction for very small RoIs (fewer than 10 voxels) using epsilon corrections (𝜀) and synthetic augmentation, supporting cases as small as single-voxel inputs.  
        │       - Corrected mathematical operations prone to errors (e.g., log(0), division by zero, sqrt of negatives, covariance matrix for single voxel, ConvexHull requirements, percentile estimation).  
        │       - Improved data loading performance with smoother and more efficient handling of medical imaging inputs.  
        │       - Extended supported input formats to include RT-Struct data paths and direct NumPy array inputs for both images and masks.  
        │       - Enhanced Excel output with two new tabs: Parameters (record of all parameters used) and Warnings and Errors (detailed runtime issues).  
        │       - Added flexible RoI selection controls:  
        │            • roi_num: defines how many RoIs to select.  
        │            • roi_selection_mode: supports per_Img and per_region strategies.  
        │       - Exposed radiomics parameters as configurable arguments, replacing hardcoded values.  
        │       - Implemented automatic padding to resolve image and mask dimension mismatches.  
        │       - Improved RoI naming in Excel outputs by including both label and lesion information when available.  
        │       - Performed codebase restructuring: renamed variables for clarity, modularized the implementation into a standalone library, updated requirements, and verified IBSI standard compliance.
